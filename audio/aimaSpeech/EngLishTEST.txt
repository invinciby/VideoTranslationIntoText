ah I was appointed six months ago and the more i've spoken about feminism the more I have realized fighting for women's rights has too often become synonymous with man hating if there is one thing I know for certain it is that this has to stop for the record feminism by definition is the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities it is the theory of the political economic and social equality of the sexesI started questioning gender base assumptions a long time ago when I was eight I was confused being called bossy because I wanted to direct the place that we would put on for our parents but the boys were not when at fourteen I started to be sexual ised by certain elements of the media when at fifteen my girlfriend started dropping out of our beloved sports teams because they didn't want to appear muscle when at eighteen my male friends were unable to express their feelings I decided I was a feminist and this seemed uncomplicated to me but my recent research has shown me that feminism has become an unpopular wordwomen are choosing not to identify as feminist apparently I am among the ranks of women whose expressions are seen as too strong too aggressive isolating and anti men on attractive even I why has the word become such an uncomfortable one I am from Britain and I think it is right that I am paid the same as my male counterparts I think it is right that I should be able to make decisions about my own body I think it is right that women be involved on my behalf in the policy use and the decisions thataffect my life I think it is right that socially I am afforded the same respect as men but sadly I can say that there is no one country in the world where all women can expect to receive these rights no country in the world can yet say that they have achieved gender equality thank you very very oh
