ah I was appointed six months ago and the more I spokeabout feminism the more I have realized fighting for women's rights has too often become synonymous with man hating if there is one thing I know for certainI think it is right that socially I am afforded the same respect as men but sadly I can say that there is no one country in the worldwhere all women can expect to receive these rights no country in the world can yet say that they have achieved gender equality thank you very very IIit is that this has to stop for the record feminism by definition is the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities it is the theoryof the political economic and social equality of the sexes I started questioning gender base assumptions a long time ago when I was eight I was confused being called bossybecause I wanted to direct the place that we would put on for our parents but the boys were not when at fourteen I started to be sexual ised by certain elements of the media when at fifteen my girlfriend started droppingbeloved sports teams because they didn't want to appear muscle when at eighteen my male friends were unable to express their feelings I decided I was a feminist and thison complicated to me but my recent research has shown me that feminism has become an unpopular word women are choosing not to identify as feministapparently I am among the ranks of women whose expressions are seen as too strong too aggressive isolating and anti menon attractive even I why has the word become such an uncomfortable one I am from Britain and I think it is right that I am paidas my male counterparts I think it is right that I should be able to make decisions about my own body I think it is right that women be involved on my behalf in the policy use and the decisions that will affect my life
