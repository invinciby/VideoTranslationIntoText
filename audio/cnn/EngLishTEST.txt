okay hello my name is bias and I will be presenting our work on during and contraction and edge hierarchies for stochastic group planning so the standard to do monistic routing problem looks like this they are given a graph with vertices and edges and to each edge assign a static real numbered sweet let's assume for now that edge weights your represent the travel time on the given edge a problem with this model is that the travel times on each edge of the graph are assumed to be exact industry Gothic settings each other the graph is labeled with either probably sick functions or discrete histograms these functions or histograms can be derived from pasttravel times of vehicles that have travelled along those edges now arguably the stochastic approach is a much more accurate model of reality not all vehicles traveling along the same edge can be assumed to take exactly the same amount of time to reverse the edge but castor gardens to be a much more complex problem while the deterministic routing has a straightforward objective that is to find the shortest path in a graph it is not immediately clear what the shortest path in a stochastic graph even means perhaps not surprisingly there is a wide of prior work on defining meaningful objects as for routing I'm just a cassock settings here we are interesting three definitions of the shortest path one that minimizes the mean risk objectivekisses results can be attributed to the ears crazy algorithm being much more selective in relaxing edges than the CSS gray algorithm now there are several other details in the paper including the theory including theoretical bounds on the rate at which the convolutions of histograms converge to gaussian and there's also a bound on the maximum approximation error that you can get on routing on the three kinds of writing credit when using the hellinger distance metric I invite you to check out the paper for more details thank you so muchfinding the police said all the best routes between the source and the destination and the prowler sick budget roots I shall come back with the precise definitions of these three objectives a little bit how to understand what makes the gas are doubting but clearly difficult let's say we have a graph with three vertices the edge weights of AB and BC are assumed to be five and three units respectively then the total edge weight from a to see is five plus three or eight years however when the edge weights are labeled with histograms the total distance between a and see can only be given by the convolution of the histograms on the two edges the expensive convolution operation that needs to be applied between histograms is the biggest challenge in stochastic itone that prevents it from being deployed much more ubiquitous Lee in spite of being a much more accurate model of reality finally there's a large number of speed of techniques that have been developed for deterministic route planning like contraction hierarchies customize with route planning hard levels CCS and so on applying similar techniques to stochastic routing is relatively understudied before I get to the during idea of a paper it is important to understand how contraction and hierarchies actually book plotting it looks like this the contraction operation is defined as follows if the shortest path from a vertex you of what is w goes through over x v then we can add a shortcut edge that connects youdirectly to a w and we can remove the word xb from do crafts similarly to construct an edge hierarchy if the shortest path from your I'm movie prime goes through an edge you v we can add one of the three list of shortcuts without affecting the correctness of her algorithm so again not one of you prime you v v I'm are you playing v and weekend with the addition edge the movie from the graph this gives us an algorithm to construct a see h are e h on a given graph first we order the vertices or edges in their increasing order of rank thencontact the vertices or the edges and finally we can add all the shortcuts derived from this procedure to the original input craft now let's go back to the stochastic routing settings in the people we are can say we are concerned with the following three definitions of shortest stochastic path to Kasey charter spots first the non dominated roots which is perhaps the most straightforward we want to find routes between s and t such that they have h re distributions that are not completely dominated by other routes we want to find probably stick budget truths that maximize the probability of travel costs being within a budget and finally the main mein risk routes where the user gives us a risk aversion coefficient see and we only want to find routes that minimize the mean travel time plus see timesthe standard deviation now prior work has applied contraction hierarchies to speed up stochastic routing queries the essential idea that our paper introduces is called to ring by which the hierarchy being built is divided into tears and an each to your we use an appropriate edge weight representation that minimizes the cost of computing convolutions number one and number two ensures that the representation is as compact and space efficient as possible using the to ring technique we propose certain contraction hierarchies and uncertain edge Rockies both of which used to deos at the lower levels of the hierarchy we use histograms because they are much more likely to represent thedistribution more accurately but they have a higher completion cost however i'd higher levels the shot cuts represent longer distances and they will have edge weights that because of the central limit theorem more closely resembled the gaussian distribution therefore we can simply replace the edge with sweet histograms for shortcuts and the upper deal with gaussian distributions without much loss in accuracy a challenge you though is determining the appropriate boundary between the tears of the hierarchy so to determine the appropriate boundary we used the following method after every lambda contraction operations we check if the edge weights of the shortcuts being added are sufficiently similar to a gaussian distribution using a similar measure we can use a CCL diversionsor hellinger distance from be considered the CCL diversions and the hellinger distance measures for our own people if the edge weights and a gaussian distribution are found to be sufficiently similar we make the verdict or the edge being country contracted the boundary between the tears using the to difference in Lahti measures gives us two variants of uncertain contraction and hierarchies we call them the k l d hierarchies and the h d hierarchy we tested a method using real-world edge level traffic data extracted from my box traffic data set between July and November two thousand and nineteen a graph has approximately two and a half hundred thousand vertices and approximately half a million edges we found that applying to ring to contractionhierarchies reduces the pre processing times for both CCL divergence and hellinger distance variance of the see h I n e h by as much as thirty seven percent photo we also observe that apply to ring improves the performance of finding non dominated roots I'm probably stick budget roots queries by up to three times in certain cases lastly these graphs show the improvement in performance for mean recruits for different values of the risk aversion coefficient a key finding of the experiments is that under stochastic settings the edge hockey's performed nearly at Harvard contraction hierarchies this is in contrast with the previously known previously known results where contraction hierarchies were known to be much better than
